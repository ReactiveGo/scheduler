// Package scheduler contains different implementations of the Scheduler
// interface.
//
// Scheduling can be characterized in two ways. First, in the way tasks are
// dispatched to the scheduler, which can be either asynchronous or
// synchronous. Second, in the way tasks are actually executed by the
// scheduler, which can be immediate, serial or concurrent.
